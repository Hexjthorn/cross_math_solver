For the Random Generator, refresh the sheet or hit F9. Refreshing the sheet will randomize the main values (white) (1-9 and randomize the operators (green) ( +, −, ×, ÷ ). Background calculations will determine the ending values (blue). The ending values have NOT been limited to being whole numbers.
